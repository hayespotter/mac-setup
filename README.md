# mac-setup
Shell scripts for setting up a mac. This was written primarily for use in my office so it may include some things you have zero use for, such as Sketch. 

## Installation and Usage
	cd
	git clone https://github.com/hayespotter/mac-setup.git && cd mac-setup/
	./mac-setup
	
If you would like to omit installing some super development specific packages and settings add a parameter of 'designer'. See notes below to see what is omitted during installation. 

	./mac-setup designer

Once the script is complete you can review the output in the log file created at ~/setup.log .

## To Update
	cd ~/mac-setup/
	git pull origin master

If you want to experiment with what I'm building out, you can checkout the 'dev' branch, no guarantees that what's in there actually works or doesn't rm -rf your home directory, @edgefall ;)
